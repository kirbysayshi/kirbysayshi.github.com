## Coffee Physics

A lightweight physics engine, written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). Why? Why not!?

Early demos can be found here: [http://soulwire.co.uk/coffeephysics/](http://soulwire.co.uk/coffeephysics/)

### Please Note

I released this super early for FITC Amsterdam, after only minor testing in Chrome. There are a lot of optimisations needed, as well as several bug fixes (mainly in the WebGL renderer) so over the coming weeks I'll be focussing on these, as well as adding 3D support.

Consider this pre-release! ;)
