Some stuff I've made.

Getting jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/):

```
# one time:
brew install chruby ruby-install
ruby-install ruby 3.4.1
# assuming there is chruby active in the shell...

chruby # prints available ruby versions
chruby ruby-3.4.1 # changes version

# install local dependencies
bundle install
# if that doesn't work due to out of date bundler/dependencies:
bundle update --bundler

# Note that I also had to:
brew install libffi
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
# in order to get ffi gem to install
```

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Remember to regen the tags and categories with:

```
node _buildscripts/generate-categories.js
node _buildscripts/generate-tags.js
```
