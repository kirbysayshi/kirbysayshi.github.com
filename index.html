<h2><a href="/projects.html">Projects<a></h2>
<p>I work on many fronts, but, lucky for you, all of my <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> are in one place.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a></h2>
<p>Writing about things I'm working on provide a breather to <a href="/blog.html">reflect</a> on what's done, and what's next.</p>

<h2><a href="/me.html">About</a></h2>
<p>Guess what, I'm a <a href="/me.html">real person</a>! But there's only one of me.</p>
