p. This animation was a group project created using a single sheet of paper. Each frame was drawn, captured with a typical digital camera, and then the next frame was drawn on the same sheet of paper, erasing what was needed. This continued until the end. Afterwards, the individual photos were processed in Adobe Lightroom and compiled in iMovie. The soundtrack (Andrew Bird's "Opposite Day") was scraped together using iMovie HD's ridiculous interface.
