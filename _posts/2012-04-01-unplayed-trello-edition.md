[Shaun Inman][] had a great idea, [Unplayed][], which is a list of all the games he's playing, trying to play, given up playing, or beaten. He has a more in-depth explanation on [his blog][], along with the source for making your own list.

I haven't really had a PHP server up and running for hosting random stuff like this in a while. I decided to instead use [Trello][] to host my own version of [Unplayed: Trello Edition][]. It's very basic, and since Trello has a hard limit to the number of labels, I had to manually include the platform in the title. Not a huge deal. The titles with green labels mean "target of current focus".

I also have one for [board games][], which I share with [Cindy Au][]
