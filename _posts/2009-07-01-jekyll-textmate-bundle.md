This bundle is super simple: press CMD + CTRL + B (for build), and
whatever textmate project you currently have open (and has focus) will
be put through Jekyll! This bundle does not install Jekyll, just invokes
it and displays the terminal output as a dialogue.

It should be visible in the GetBundles bundle, or in the textmate ruby
gem, as it’s on [GitHub](http://github.com/kirbysayshi/jekyll.tmbundle).

This is the first Textmate bundle I’ve developed. Yay!
