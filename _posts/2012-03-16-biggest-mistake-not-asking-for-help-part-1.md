I spent around 5 years in college and didn't graduate.

Why?

Too many individual moments, too many problems to completely recount. However, I believe there was truly a root cause, made plain only in hindsight; I'll probably think it was something else a few years from now.

I had a really hard time asking for help. 

I don't mean help on homework or help studying. I mean help with the most important question during college: _what am I doing here?_ My college was large, about 40,000 students during my time there. At a large school, it's pretty easy to get lost in the sea of your fellow students, but that's not what the problem was.

When I graduated high school, I wasn't excited in the least to go to college. Actually, I take that back. I was excited to be on my own. But not school itself.

This was due to two reasons:

- I was honestly sick of "school", that is the act of being told what to learn, how to learn it, and when you should have learned it by. This is not how I operate; learning is much more fluid for me.
- I had no idea what I would study. 

I've heard from many students, parents, and advisors that your first years of college are supposed to be spent experimenting with classes and trying things you wouldn't normally have tried. When I was told this, I was excited! I'd finally do some audio engineering with professional guidance! Ooh, maybe an intro to quantum mechanics? And yes, I'll learn how to _actually_ make a video game using real code! [^1]

At my initial orientation, where you sign up for classes, I looked at the printed course guide for the first time ever. It went like this:

> Ok, let's try for some awesome quantum mechanics class... ooh! "Quantum Mechanics 531: must have sophomore status or better and be accepted to the school of Physics." Oh. Alright, what about something to do with audio? "Acoustics for Musicians" sounds perfect! Oh, there are only two sections of 30 students each, and all are filled. Moving on, what about Game Design? Hmm... not a single class or even a department... I guess I could take a computer science course? Ugh, I really don't want to grow up and live in a cubicle. [^2] I want to make games, not work at Initech. Also, I'm horrible at math.

Several things are wrong with this entire scenario.

I probably should have researched classes beforehand, but not being excited about even going made procrastination easy. Also, who do you ask about these things? My high school guidance councelor? She's just looking in the same huge, phonebook-like tomb of class descriptions that are barely a sentence long with arcane requirement abbreviations that you are. [^3]

And now we're back to where we started with this post. I should have said to myself, "Drew, it's ok to not know what you're doing, it's not a sign of idiocy that you don't just know!" And I should have called the college advisor's office and scheduled a meeting to figure this stuff out.

In addition, there are some severe things wrong with the system, which I'll talk about in [part 2][].

I spent a few semesters just trying to find something that I could use to get me out of school. Creative Writing? No, that's actually an English degree, and seriously, am I actually going to become a full-time writer? How about music? Apparently I'm just not as good or dedicated as I should be, I can't even get into the music program, and all classes require that you be in the program. So that passion must remain personal. How about art? I guess I like drawing cartoons, and web development is related to web design, which is like graphic design, which is a specialization of an art degree...  

There were several good things that came out of college:

* I met my girlfriend due to comic books on a shelf.
* Used my job teaching software classes to other college students to teach myself Flash, C#, PHP, SQL...
* Used this job to meet interesting people across disciplines.
* Used this job to find freelance work (people liked the way I taught, and assumed I knew what I was talking about).
* Built a really cool (in my opinion) brass and copper decoder ring for a cipher of my own design.
* Realized that I'm not much of a designer.
* Realized that traditional schooling is completely contrary to how I learn.
* Realized that a four-year college does practically nothing to actually prepare you for a job, and that everyone is strangely aware and ok with that.

Please note that none of these things are what people typically assume you're going to get out of college. In this regard, I succeeded: I created a unique experience that prepared me for life outside school.[^4]

But it's easy to look back now, and know that I made the right choice to leave. It was a lot harder back then.

[^2]: I had the mistaken idea that all software development was performed by souless beasts that never saw daylight, always wore shortsleeved button-downs, and lacked any social skills.

[^3]: This was before online course guides were actually useable, and before the guides were even indexable by Google.

[^4]: "Prepared" is an ambitious description.
