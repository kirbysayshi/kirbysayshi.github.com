This was created in response to an assignment, the constraints of which
were to create an animation of our choosing in Flash. Because it was an
assignment, and was meant to be viewed more as a movie than a Flash
animation (ie, over the web), it requires a fairly well-endowed computer
to run at a nice speed. It was originally set to run at 1280x720
fullscreen.

This was made sometime in February/March of 2008.

The subject matter is a conversation a friend of mine had with a
stranger while smoking outside. In the city where this took place, there
is a ban that prevents indoor smoking, and often causes smokers to
inadvertently interact with each other. This animation explores that
idea.
