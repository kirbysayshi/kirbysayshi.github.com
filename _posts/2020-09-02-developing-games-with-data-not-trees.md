In 2014 I presented at JSConf EU in Berlin on topics close to my heart: game development patterns and data-oriented design. This talk is a mix of (hopefully) humorous performance and information, but at its core is the notion that encoding your experience as data and functions that operate on that data allows for a more malleable system than one relying strictly on a class hierarchy.

The code in this talk relies heavily on an architectural pattern known as [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system).
