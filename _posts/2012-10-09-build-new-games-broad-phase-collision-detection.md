I wrote an article on collision detection for [Build New Games][], and it's live! Check it out [here][].

For this article, I wrote a demo engine, and the whole thing is on [Github][] for easy perusing. Something I discovered is that if you create a project/repo on Github, and then only push the `gh-pages` branch, it is used as the default _automatically_, and you never have to worry about committing/syncing between `master` and `gh-pages`. NEAT.
