experimenting takes money!
every master's program sounds more interesting than undergrad
not enough staff to support this


TL;DR: I don't have a solve for education. But dammit if I don't try for one every day, and you should too.

I spent around 5 years in college and didn't graduate. There are many reasons why, but those aren't important right now.

Whenever I talk to friends and collegues with advanced degrees (Masters, PH.D.), and whenever I look back upon periods when I've learned much in a short amount of time, I find a theme: self-directed but guided study.

Let's dissect this phrase:

* Self-directed: You pick what you want to work on, how you want to work on it, and why you've chosen it.

* Guided: An outside observer, whether a teacher, friend, colleague, parent, mentor, or other, helps you answer the questions of "what?", "how?", "where?", and "why?". Sometimes "who?", as well. In guiding these questions, this observer can prevent you from becoming stuck, or from performing only lateral movement.

I believe this environment is typically found in a grad student - professor relationship, from what I've been told. 

But I've found it in other enviroments. One that comes to mind was when I was trying to take over development of a web site for a student org. I knew some basic programming, but had never tackled C# and .NET before (ahhhhhhhhh WebForms no why have you done this to me!). Luckily, the current but soon to be gone developer Paul sat next to me. We worked side by side for a few months while I tried to implement a new feature. 

> Me: Paul.
> Paul: Yeah, Drew.
> Me: WTF is this.
> Paul: That's the power button.
> Me: Thanks.

In all honesty, it wasn't as banal as that. But Paul made himself available for questions, and even thoough I proceeded slowly, I always felt like I was making progress. I never felt that "bang your head against the wall" feeling that can often occur when learning something new.

Since then, I've encountered this repeatedly, and tried to facilliate it for others as much as I can.

I've learned one thing though: it's really hard! This is especially true when you're expected to be working on your own projects at the same time.

For the entirety of the time I've spent in the education system, I've longed for this environment. And now I realize why we rarely receive it in an institutionalized setting: it doesn't scale!

///// insert image here
// much like this, real education does not scale.

And that's why it's so hard, and that's why when whoever figured out that putting a bunch of kids in a room and having one person talk to them made at least some of them remember something, the system stuck.

But we can't afford for it to stick to just some students (nevermind what that something actually is; for most students it's probably memorized-without-comprehension-facts) anymore, especially when it seems like the smartest ones among us are the ones worst-served by the system.

I have nothing to prove this, no numbers to back any of this up. I only know what I experienced: my most motivating, purposeful, and productive periods of learning were when I had a direct connection to someone else. 

I do want to throw something out there though, with that programming example I gave earlier regarding Paul. At that time, there was no [StackOverflow]. StackOverflow is actually one concentrated example where the internet is your sounding board, where the internet functions as your outside observer. Sure, you can write a blog post or ask on Twitter, but if you don't have some level of notoriety, who's going to read it? StackOverflow is nearly instantaneous. 

In this sense, StackOverflow has created a solution to scaling programmer education.

There's an issue here, though. So far, this environment I've been describing assumes that the student is interested enough in _something_ to actually put effort into learning it. How does this environment help the student that can't help themself, either through idiocy (e.g. the bicycle helmet law: the brain needs to be told to protect itself through law... I'm guilty of this too), or environment (no time, no money, no one to help you by saying, "yes, you need to learn this stuff")?

Well this is two issues, with most likely a million different solutions. Here is an uniformed "solution".

Right now, society puts a lot of focus on succeeding, whether in money, life, love, skills, whatever. I think most everyone has heard that Thomas Edison failed X thousand times trying to invent the lightbulb, and that this was ok, because it was a learning experience. 

And yet... where in a person's life is this actually accepted and ok? Maybe love? Only in certain cultures. For an American student, there is no time for failure, no time for floundering. I recall in high school, there were students who, because they hadn't done that well in some class in like 5th grade, were forced, for the rest of their academic lives (10 more years!), to take a less advanced course track. What if they just weren't good at math at that point in their lives? By the time they got to college, they were years behind.

What about that mythical time in college when you're supposed to figure out what you want to do with your life, and what degree will get you there? You're supposed to do this by trying out a bunch of classes in various disciplines. How many students have the time and money to spend extra years in college doing this? There's so much pressure to get it right the first time, that fear of failure becomes more prominent than the excitement of exploration.

My point to all of this is that we need to make it ok to fail. And not just to fail once, but repeatedly. The effort is what's important. Not fake effort ("I swear Mrs. Patterson, I tried really hard to stop Sparky from eating my homework..."), but someone actually trying. This isn't just a mental issue though, there need to be institutionalized failure periods, where it's encouraged for you to just... fail. All the time. Start a business. Fail. Become a blacksmith. Fail. Write for a living. Fail. 

And what happens if a person fails at everything? 

I believe this to be impossible; I have too much faith in humanity.
